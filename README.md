# Unique 16S sequences from Urobiome

##Background
This is a creation of a phylogenetic tree from a fasta file for my masters thesis. The file contains 292 unique 16S sequences representative of urobiome bacterial species.

These unique 16S rRNA sequences contain 123 species and 61 genera. The sequences are a combination of 16S sequences from my collection and 16S sequences from LUC's urobiome genome collection (NCBI BioProject PRJNA316969). Combined, these sequences represent the diversity of bacterial species from the female urobiome. More details on the thesis project can be found here:
