# Unique 16S sequences from Female Urobiome

## About

A 16S rRNA gene sequence database called "Field Guide to the Urobiome" was created for my master of science thesis project by combining unique 16S rRNA gene sequences from our sample collection and all 16S sequences from Loyola University Chicago's publicly available urobiome genome sequences. All rna_genomic files for genome assemblies in the BioProject PRJNA316969 were downloaded. This BioProject includes all urobiome genome assemblies from the Wolfe labâ€™s collection. Complete 16S rRNA gene sequences were extracted from the genomes. For construction of this database, all of the 16S sequences from the publicly available genomes were compared to the 16S rRNA gene sequences from my sequenced isolates. Multiple sequence alignment was performed using MAFFT v. 7.490 through Geneious Prime. Duplicate sequences were removed as were sequences that were subsequences of a longer representative sequence. The final set of sequences were aligned, again using MAFFT, and a phylogenetic tree was derived for these sequences using FastTree v. 2.1.11 (M. N. Price et al., 2010). The tree was visualized using iTOL v. 6 (Letunic & Bork, 2021).

This is a creation of an iTOL phylogenetic tree from a FASTA file. This file contains 292 unique 16S sequences representative of urobiome bacterial species. These unique 16S rRNA sequences contain 123 species and 61 genera.

## Significance

Combined, these sequences represent the diversity of bacterial species from the female urobiome. Making this 16S rRNA gene sequence tree/database captures the species diversity found in the female urinary tract of both healthy and symptomatic individuals. Samples come from both asymptomatic females as well as females with recurrent UTI (rUTI) and acute UTI symptoms. The 16S rRNA gene sequences retrieved from the BioProject also include isolates from females with urge urinary incontenance (UUI), overactive bladder (OAB), and stress urinary incontinence (SUI) (K. Thomas-White et al., 2018b). There are several urobiome studies that have focused on characterizing the bacterial composition in healthy and symptomatic individuals. This work has relied on conducting 16S surveys of bacteria in the bladder. These surveys are often taken from adult females, as urinary conditions and infections disproportionately affect more women than men (Irwin et al., 2006; Magliano et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2015). The biggest significance of this resource is its utility to aid in identifying taxa for high-throughput 16S rRNA gene surveys of the adult female urobiome. Most databases of 16S rRNA gene sequences lack a representation of diversity in urobiome species (Brubaker et al., 2021). Thus, the sequences generated as part of this study could be used to aid in taxonomic profiling of 16S rRNA gene data sets from urine.
