# Unique 16S sequences from Female Urobiome

## Background

A 16S rRNA gene sequence database called "Field Guide to the Urobiome" was created for my master of science project by combining unique 16S rRNA gene sequences from our sample collection and all 16S sequences from Loyola University Chicago's publicly available urobiome genome sequences. All rna_genomic files for genome assemblies in the BioProject PRJNA316969 were downloaded. This BioProject includes all urobiome genome assemblies from the Wolfe labâ€™s collection. Complete 16S rRNA gene sequences were extracted from the genomes. For construction of this database, all of the 16S sequences from the publicly available genomes were compared to the 16S rRNA gene sequences from my sequenced isolates. Multiple sequence alignment was performed using MAFFT v. 7.490 through Geneious Prime. Duplicate sequences were removed as were sequences that were subsequences of a longer representative sequence. The final set of sequences were aligned, again using MAFFT, and a phylogenetic tree was derived for these sequences using FastTree v. 2.1.11 (M. N. Price et al., 2010). The tree was visualized using iTOL v. 6 (Letunic & Bork, 2021).

## About

This is a creation of an iTOL phylogenetic tree from a FASTA file. This file contains 292 unique 16S sequences representative of urobiome bacterial species.

These unique 16S rRNA sequences contain 123 species and 61 genera. The sequences are a combination of 16S sequences from my collection and 16S sequences from LUC's urobiome genome collection (NCBI BioProject PRJNA316969). Combined, these sequences represent the diversity of bacterial species from the female urobiome. More details on the thesis project can be found here:
